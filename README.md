# Display-sensitivity-maps-for-EEG-OPM-MEG-sensors
Such maps are used to know how much sources are visible by a type of sensor, and how much projections shadow some sources
- Task to do

- Export the channel from Brainstorm to Matlab (extract the meg)
- Compute the lead field
- in the script of reduce.py compute the sensitivity map
- From Bst plot using the Imaggridmap
